              There are two ways to withdraw money
            </span>
            <span className="block">From a received money message:</span>
            When someone sends you money, you&apos;ll see a &apos;Withdraw&apos;
            button next to the message. Click it to start the withdrawal process
            for that specific amount.
            <span className="mt-2 block">From your Zeday account balance:</span>
            Open the keyboard menu in your Telegram chat with Chapagram. If you
            donâ€™t see the keyboard, tap the four-rectangle icon (a square grid)
            on the right side of your Telegram message input field. A list of
            buttons will appear. Look for the one labeled &apos;Zeday&apos;. If
            it&apos;s not on the first screen, use the Next or Previous button
            to navigate. After selecting &apos;Zeday&apos;, tap the
            &apos;Withdraw&apos; button. Chapagram will prompt you to choose
            from which account you&apos;d like to withdraw the money. Follow the
            steps that follow to complete your withdrawal.
